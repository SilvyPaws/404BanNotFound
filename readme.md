# Bans don't exist in my world

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for Resonite.

In Resonite, "Public Bans" are a special type of ban the Resonite moderators can place on an account. Public-banned users cannot join sessions, and cannot invite others to their sessions.

This mod disables the public ban check in your client. This allows:
- public-banned users can join sessions you are hosting
- you can join sessions hosted by public-banned users

This mod does NOT affect normal session-level bans! It ONLY disables the Resonite-wide bans imposed by the moderation team. You will still be able to ban users from sessions you host if you use this mod.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [404BanNotFound.dll](https://github.com/SilvyPaws/404BanNotFound/releases/latest/download/404BanNotFound.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
